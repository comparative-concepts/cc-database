# Relation trees between different CCs

In this folder you can find files depicting the relations between different Comparative Concepts. 
These trees are manually created and there can be some discrepancies between these and what's actually in the CC database, 
but the goal is that there should be a one-to-one correspondence between these trees and what is stored in the database.

There is also an interactive graph visualization of the CC database [which you can play around with here](https://comparative-concepts.github.io/cc-database/cc-graph.html).
