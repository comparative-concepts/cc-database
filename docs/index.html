a concept that denotes an event (with its attendant participants, tense, aspect, modality, and polarity) that has a truth value in a particular context – that is, it may be true or false in that context. Example: in John believes that Mary took the car to the repair shop, Mary took the car to the repair shop is a proposition; it has a truth value in the context of John's beliefs. A pragmatic assertion expresses a proposition that is taken to be true in the speaker's beliefs. (Sections 11.1, 18.2.2)">proposition</a> in a <a href="#causal-(sem)" title="causal [sem]

Example: I left the party because I was tired is a figure–ground construal of the simultaneous relation in an adverbial clause construction, and I was tired and (so) I left the party is a complex figure construal of the relation in a coordinate clause construction. In the figure–ground construal, the causing event (the protasis; Section 17.3.2) is construed as the ground, and expressed in the adverbial dependent clause. Causal relations also occur in conditional, concessive, concessive conditional, and comparative conditional constructions.

a semantic relation between two events that involves a logical material implication relation between their corresponding propositions, some type of causal relation between the corresponding events, and non-positive epistemic stance; and the construction that expresses that relation. Example: If you press this button, the door will open is an instance of the conditional relation and construction.

a relation between two events such that there is an expected causal relation between the two events, but the opposite of the second event, expressed in the apodosis, unexpectedly occurs. Example: Although it was raining, I went out is an instance of a concessive relation and construction: the expected causal relation is that rain would lead to my staying in; but in fact I went out. The speaker has a positive epistemic stance toward the concessive construction. A concessive may express a content, epistemic, or speech act causal relation.

a causal relation between a set of events that are associated with a scalar model on the one hand, and another event, such that the other event would occur under the entire range of conditions described in the scalar model associated with the first set of events; and the construction that expresses that relation. Example: However much advice you give him, he does exactly what he wants to do is an instance of the concessive conditional relation and construction – the protasis However much advice you give him introduces a scalar model of your giving him a full range of amounts of advice; and the apodosis he does exactly what he wants to do describes the event that occurs or would occur under any of those conditions. The speaker has a neutral epistemic stance toward the range of events associated with the scalar model. The apodosis has an unexpected causal relation with respect to the set of events that make up the protasis. A concessive conditional may express a content, epistemic, or speech act causal relation. (Section 17.3.3)">concessive conditional</a>, or <a href="#comparative-conditional-construction-(cxn)" title="comparative conditional construction [cxn] ⟹ comparative conditional relation [sem] / construction [cxn]

a relation between two events, each on a gradable predicative scale, such that an event at one degree on the first predicative scale causes an event at the corresponding degree on the second predicative scale. Example: The longer that Bill had to wait, the angrier he got is an instance of the comparative conditional relation and construction: a degree of length of time that Bill had to wait can (in a generic conditional) or does (in an ordinary, specific conditional) cause the occurrence of the corresponding degree of Bill's anger.

(Sections 1.1, 2.3)">grammaticalization</a> of <a href="#purpose-(sem)" title="purpose [sem]

the semantic relation between two events where one event serves as the intended outcome as a result of bringing about the other event. Example: I will grab a stick to defend myself is a figure–ground construal of the simultaneous relation in an adverbial clause construction, and I will grab a stick and defend myself is a complex figure construal of the relation in a coordinate clause construction. In the figure–ground construal, the intended event is construed as the ground. The intended event is unrealized, which disfavors a complex figure construal (this problem is avoided in the example here because both events are future events).

a complex sentence construction with a figure–ground construal / information packaging of the relation between the events denoted by the two clauses.

the construction in a logophoric system for complement clause constructions that is used when a participant in the complement event is coreferential with the speaker, addressee, or experiencer of an utterance, propositional attitude, knowledge, or commentative event. Example: Donno Sɔ Oumar Anta inyemɛñ waa be gi Oumari said that Anta had seen himi is an instance of the logophoric construction – the reference to Oumar in the complement clause uses a special pronoun form inyemɛñ.

an event of saying in which one participant is the speaker of the utterance and another participant is the utterance itself; and the predicate expressing such an event.

Some predicates denoting utterance events include the addressee as an argument, as in Sandy told me that she's buying the house. (Section 18.2.2)">utterance</a>, <a href="#propositional-attitude-event-(sem)-predicate-(cxn)" title="propositional attitude event [sem] / predicate [cxn]

an event of thinking, believing, and so on that expresses an attitude of the experiencer toward the truth of the proposition expressed by the complement; and the predicate expressing such an event. Example: in Aram thought that the pianist was very good, the complement-taking predicate thought denotes a propositional attitude event. Special cases of propositional attitude events are knowledge events and pretense events. (Section 18.2.2)">propositional attitude</a>, <a href="#knowledge-event-(sem)-predicate-(cxn)" title="knowledge event [sem] / predicate [cxn]

a propositional attitude event in which a positive epistemic stance toward the relevant proposition expressed is presupposed to be taken by the speaker; and the predicate expressing such an event. Example: in Sally knows that Donald won the election, Sally's belief with respect to the proposition that Donald won the election is reported by the speaker; and, in addition, a positive epistemic stance is taken by the speaker toward that proposition (i.e., the speaker believes that Donald indeed won the election).

an event in which an evaluative judgment is made about the truth of the proposition expressed in its complement; and a predicate expressing this event. Evaluative events may assume different epistemic stances toward the proposition expressed in their complement. Commentative events assume a positive epistemic stance; hoping and fearing events assume a neutral epistemic stance; and wishing events assume a negative epistemic stance. (Section 18.2.2)">evaluative</a>, <a href="#perception-event-(sem)-verb-(cxn)-complement-taking-predicate-(cxn)" title="perception event [sem] / verb [cxn] / complement-taking predicate [cxn]

an experiential event involving one (or more) of the sensory modalities and directed toward a stimulus. The stimulus may be either an object or an event. A perception verb is a verb that expresses the event of perceiving an object. Example: Tim heard the macaw is an example of a perception event, and hear is the perception verb (Section 7.4). A perception complement-taking predicate is a predicate that expresses perceiving an event, which is expressed as the complement event of the predicate. Example: in We watched the elk graze in the caldera, watched denotes a perception event. The complement event has dependent time reference; the complement event must be occurring at the same time as the perceiving event (although modern media allowing watching a prior event via a recording). (Section 18.2.2)">perception</a> &lt; <a href="#desiderative-event-(sem)-predicate-(cxn)" title="desiderative event [sem] / predicate [cxn]

an event that expresses a desire toward the realization of a future event that is expressed by the complement; and the predicate that expresses the event. Example: in Meagan wants to climb Mt.

(Section 12.1)">modal</a>, <a href="#phasal-aspect-(sem)" title="phasal aspect [sem]

a type of aspect that expresses the phases of an event: beginning, continuing, terminating, or completion. Phasal aspect is often, but not always, expressed by a complement-taking predicate in a complement clause construction. Example: in Bill started to play the piano, started expresses phasal aspect – namely, the beginning phase of the complement event of playing the piano. (Section 18.2.2)">phasal</a>.

a relation between two events, each on a gradable predicative scale, such that an event at one degree on the first predicative scale causes an event at the corresponding degree on the second predicative scale. Example: The longer that Bill had to wait, the angrier he got is an instance of the comparative conditional relation and construction: a degree of length of time that Bill had to wait can (in a generic conditional) or does (in an ordinary, specific conditional) cause the occurrence of the corresponding degree of Bill's anger.

a relation between two events such that there is an expected causal relation between the two events, but the opposite of the second event, expressed in the apodosis, unexpectedly occurs. Example: Although it was raining, I went out is an instance of a concessive relation and construction: the expected causal relation is that rain would lead to my staying in; but in fact I went out.

a causal relation between a set of events that are associated with a scalar model on the one hand, and another event, such that the other event would occur under the entire range of conditions described in the scalar model associated with the first set of events; and the construction that expresses that relation. Example: However much advice you give him, he does exactly what he wants to do is an instance of the concessive conditional relation and construction – the protasis However much advice you give him introduces a scalar model of your giving him a full range of amounts of advice; and the apodosis he does exactly what he wants to do describes the event that occurs or would occur under any of those conditions. The speaker has a neutral epistemic stance toward the range of events associated with the scalar model.

the semantic relation between two events where one event causes the other. Example: I left the party because I was tired is a figure–ground construal of the simultaneous relation in an adverbial clause construction, and I was tired and (so) I left the party is a complex figure construal of the relation in a coordinate clause construction. In the figure–ground construal, the causing event (the protasis; Section 17.3.2) is construed as the ground, and expressed in the adverbial dependent clause.

Epistemic stance is divided by Fillmore (1990b) into three categories: positive, neutral, and negative. Others use a finer-grained categorization (e.g., partial positive and partial negative), and still others refer to a continuum of hypotheticality.

The comparative construction therefore consists of three propositions: the predicative scale applies to the comparee, it also applies to the standard, and the comparee exceeds the standard on the scale. Example: The tree is taller than the house is an instance of the comparative construction – the comparee is the tree, the standard is the house, the gradable comparative scale is height, and the comparee exceeds the standard in height.

in a comparative construction or equative construction, the referent whose position on the gradable predicative scale is specified relative to the position of the standard on the predicative scale.

(Sections 17.2.1, 17.2.4)">comparee</a>, and another which asserts that the comparee exceeds the <a href="#standard-(sem)" title="standard [sem]

in a comparative construction or equative construction, the referent whose position on the gradable predicative scale serves as the reference point for the position of the comparee on the predicative scale. Example: in Your cat is bigger than my dog, the dog serves as the standard for the position of the cat on the scale of size – it is asserted that the cat exceeds the dog on that scale.

a type of modality which expresses the attitude of a speaker or other conceiver toward performing an action (i.e. making the action come true). Example: Jerry must get his hair cut is an instance of deontic modality: the speaker expresses her attitude that the situation necessarily will come about. Deontic modality is construed broadly in this textbook, to include wishes as well as intentions and commands, attitude toward oneself performing the action as well as toward others performing the action, and to include objective as well as subjective characterization of the attitude. (Sections 12.1, 12.4)">deontic modal</a> situation. <em>Examples</em>: in English <em>You may leave now</em>, a <a href="#subjective-(sem)" title="subjective [sem]

describing an entity from the implicit perspective of the speaker and the speech event, e.g. the speech event time. Example: in the subjective epistemic modal construction Wendy might be in Santa Fe, the uncertainty about Wendy being in Santa Fe is that of the speaker at the time of the speech event, although neither of these pieces of information (the speaker or the time of the speech event) are explicitly expressed in the sentence. (Section 12.3.4)">subjective</a> deontic modal construction, the event is in the future from the speech act time (that is, simple future). In English <em>Carol intended to close the door</em>, an <a href="#objective-(sem)" title="objective [sem]

describing an entity from an outside, explicit perspective on the entity, in contrast to a subjective construal. Example: in the objective epistemic modal construction Jim thought that Wendy was in Santa Fe, the attitude about whether Wendy being in Santa Fe is true is that of Jim, not the speaker, and in the past, not at the time of the speech event; both of these pieces of information are explicitly expressed in the sentence (Jim and thought). It is also possible to construe speaker attitude at the speech event time as objective, as in I think that Wendy was in Santa Fe, where speaker (I) and speaker attitude (think) are explicitly expressed. (Section 12.3.4)">objective</a> deontic modal construction, the event is in the future from the reported deontic modal event time: that is, closing the door is projected to a future from the past event of Carol's having the intention.

a concept that denotes an event (with its attendant participants, tense, aspect, modality, and polarity) that has a truth value in a particular context – that is, it may be true or false in that context. Example: in John believes that Mary took the car to the repair shop, Mary took the car to the repair shop is a proposition; it has a truth value in the context of John's beliefs. A pragmatic assertion expresses a proposition that is taken to be true in the speaker's beliefs. (Sections 11.1, 18.2.2)">proposition</a> which contains information that is unknown. Interrogative complements commonly occur in certain types of <a href="#propositional-attitude-event-(sem)-predicate-(cxn)" title="propositional attitude event [sem] / predicate [cxn]

an event of thinking, believing, and so on that expresses an attitude of the experiencer toward the truth of the proposition expressed by the complement; and the predicate expressing such an event. Example: in Aram thought that the pianist was very good, the complement-taking predicate thought denotes a propositional attitude event. Special cases of propositional attitude events are knowledge events and pretense events.

Interrogative complements are often found in the <a href="#objective-(sem)" title="objective [sem]

describing an entity from an outside, explicit perspective on the entity, in contrast to a subjective construal. Example: in the objective epistemic modal construction Jim thought that Wendy was in Santa Fe, the attitude about whether Wendy being in Santa Fe is true is that of Jim, not the speaker, and in the past, not at the time of the speech event; both of these pieces of information are explicitly expressed in the sentence (Jim and thought). It is also possible to construe speaker attitude at the speech event time as objective, as in I think that Wendy was in Santa Fe, where speaker (I) and speaker attitude (think) are explicitly expressed. (Section 12.3.4)">objective</a> construal of <a href="#epistemic-modality-(sem)" title="epistemic modality [sem]

a type of modality that expresses the attitude of a speaker or other conceiver toward the truth of the situation described in the clause – that is, degree of certainty that the situation is true. Example: Jerry might get his hair cut is an instance of epistemic modality – the speaker is expressing a relatively neutral attitude toward whether the future situation will actually come about. Epistemic modality is construed broadly in this textbook, to include objective as well as subjective characterization of the epistemic modal attitude. (Sections 12.1, 12.3.4)">epistemic modality</a>.

Example: the numeral modification construction exemplified by three tree-s consists of a form which: (i) can be described schematically as [Num Noun-number]; (ii) performs the function of referring to a group of objects of the type denoted by the noun (tree), and modifying that information with the additional information that the cardinality of the group is the amount denoted by the number (three).

the basic unit of morphosyntactic analysis; a construction is a conventional pairing of form and function – its form is morphosyntactic structure, and its function is a combination of meaning (semantic content) and information packaging (Section 1.1). When combined with a modifier describing a specific construction, [Modifier] construction refers to any pairing of form and function in a language (or any language) used to express a particular combination of semantic content and information packaging denoted by the modifier of construction (Section 1.4). Example: the numeral modification construction exemplified by three tree-s consists of a form which: (i) can be described schematically as [Num Noun-number]; (ii) performs the function of referring to a group of objects of the type denoted by the noun (tree), and modifying that information with the additional information that the cardinality of the group is the amount denoted by the number (three). Specific constructions (a.k.a. criteria, tests, evidence) are used to define word classes.

the prototypical type of modification information packaging function in which the modifying stative concept narrows or restricts the set of possible referents of the object concept it modifies in a referring phrase.

a strategy in which the predicate in a complex sentence or a complex predicate construction does not recruit the predicate construction in a simple predication, in contrast to the balanced strategy. Instead, the deranked predicate either: (i) lacks the inflections of the predicate; (ii) uses different inflections from the predicate; (iii) has an affix that overtly codes its relation to the other predicate; or some combination of these three possibilities. Example: in Reaching the top of the hill, Ron found a stone monument, the predicate reaching is a deranked form: it lacks verbal inflections and is overtly coded by the suffix -ing. Deranked predicate forms are also called infinitives, gerunds, participles, verbal nouns, masdars, action nominals, and nominalizations.

the basic unit of morphosyntactic analysis; a construction is a conventional pairing of form and function – its form is morphosyntactic structure, and its function is a combination of meaning (semantic content) and information packaging (Section 1.1). When combined with a modifier describing a specific construction, [Modifier] construction refers to any pairing of form and function in a language (or any language) used to express a particular combination of semantic content and information packaging denoted by the modifier of construction (Section 1.4). Example: the numeral modification construction exemplified by three tree-s consists of a form which: (i) can be described schematically as [Num Noun-number]; (ii) performs the function of referring to a group of objects of the type denoted by the noun (tree), and modifying that information with the additional information that the cardinality of the group is the amount denoted by the number (three).

in complex sentence constructions that express reference tracking, the situation where the salient participant in the current clause is indicated as not coreferential with the salient participant in another clause in the construction. The salient participant is typically, but not always, encoded as the subject of the predicate. Example: in Harry having finished preparing the salad, Bill brought it to the table, the overt referring phrase Harry in Harry having finished preparing the salad signals that the subject referent of finishing the salad is not coreferential with the subject referent of the matrix clause – namely, Bill.

There are a wide variety of strategies used for relative clauses, including externally headed, internally headed, adjoined, correlative, noun-modifying clause and verb-coding, as well as participles.

Example: in I ate the cheesecake [that Carol baked], that Carol baked is the relative clause. (Section 19.1)">relative clause</a> precedes the <a href="#relative-clause-head-(cxn)" title="relative clause head [cxn]

the referring phrase that denotes the necessarily shared participant in a relative clause construction – that is, the participant that plays a semantic role in both the event denoted by the relative clause and the event denoted by the matrix clause. Example: in I ate the cheesecake [that Carol baked], the cheesecake is the relative clause head. The relative clause head is an argument of the matrix clause predicate, and is modified by the relative clause. (Section 19.1)">relative clause head</a>. <em>Example</em>: in Turkish [<em>Hasanın Sinana ver-diğ-i</em>] <em>patatesi yedim</em> <q>I ate the potato that Hasan gave to Sinan</q>, the <em>Hasanın Sinana ver-diğ-i</em> <q>[that] Hasan gave to Sinan</q> is prenominal because it precedes the relative clause head <em>patatesi</em> <q>potato</q>. The prenominal strategy is much less common than the <a href="#postnominal-strategy-(str)" title="postnominal strategy [str]

When combined with a modifier describing a specific construction, [Modifier] construction refers to any pairing of form and function in a language (or any language) used to express a particular combination of semantic content and information packaging denoted by the modifier of construction (Section 1.4). Example: the numeral modification construction exemplified by three tree-s consists of a form which: (i) can be described schematically as [Num Noun-number]; (ii) performs the function of referring to a group of objects of the type denoted by the noun (tree), and modifying that information with the additional information that the cardinality of the group is the amount denoted by the number (three).

This possession relation could be full ownership, temporary ownership (someone lent it to me), or physical contiguity (I have a pen at hand).

the basic unit of morphosyntactic analysis; a construction is a conventional pairing of form and function – its form is morphosyntactic structure, and its function is a combination of meaning (semantic content) and information packaging (Section 1.1). When combined with a modifier describing a specific construction, [Modifier] construction refers to any pairing of form and function in a language (or any language) used to express a particular combination of semantic content and information packaging denoted by the modifier of construction (Section 1.4). Example: the numeral modification construction exemplified by three tree-s consists of a form which: (i) can be described schematically as [Num Noun-number]; (ii) performs the function of referring to a group of objects of the type denoted by the noun (tree), and modifying that information with the additional information that the cardinality of the group is the amount denoted by the number (three).

the interactions among participants in an event, specifically causal interactions (although there are other types of interactions among participants in an event which are subsumed under the term). Example: in The cats scratched the furniture, the cats act on the furniture, and the furniture undergoes a change of state. The causal structure of events that is expressed by a single argument structure construction in a single clause is generally in the form of a causal chain.

Example: Hindi [ādmī ne jis cākū se murgī ko mārāthā] us cākū ko rām ne dekhā Ram saw the knife with which the man killed the chicken is an instance of the correlative strategy: the relative clause ādmī ne jis cākū se murgī ko mārāthā The man killed the chicken with which knife contains the relative clause head cākū knife, modified by the relative pronoun jis which, and is preposed to the matrix clause us cākū ko rām ne dekhā that knife Ram saw, which contains a second expression of the relative clause head us cākū that knife.

Example: in Luganda ekiso [John kyeyattisa enkoko] the knife with which John killed the chicken, the predicate kyeyattisa killed contains the instrumental applicative suffix -is that indicates that the relative clause head ekiso knife denotes the instrument participant in the killing event.

Example: I love you more than him uses a derived-case strategy – the referring phrase referring to the standard, him, uses the Object flag because the referring phrase referring to the comparee, you, is in the Object case. Derived-case strategies include the conjoined comparative strategy, the particle comparative and equative strategies, the conjoined exceed comparative strategy, the relative-based equative strategy, and the relative equal equative strategy. (Section 17.2.2)">derived-case strategy</a> for <a href="#equative-construction-(cxn)" title="equative construction [cxn]

a construction that has the semantic function of assigning the identical position on a gradable predicative scale to two referents, the comparee and the standard. Example: The tree is as tall as the house is an instance of the equative construction: the comparee is the tree, the standard is the house, the gradable comparative scale is height, and the comparee is equal to the standard in height. (Section 17.2.4)">equative constructions</a> which consists of a <a href="#relative-clause-(cxn)" title="relative clause [cxn]

the basic unit of morphosyntactic analysis; a construction is a conventional pairing of form and function – its form is morphosyntactic structure, and its function is a combination of meaning (semantic content) and information packaging (Section 1.1). When combined with a modifier describing a specific construction, [Modifier] construction refers to any pairing of form and function in a language (or any language) used to express a particular combination of semantic content and information packaging denoted by the modifier of construction (Section 1.4). Example: the numeral modification construction exemplified by three tree-s consists of a form which: (i) can be described schematically as [Num Noun-number]; (ii) performs the function of referring to a group of objects of the type denoted by the noun (tree), and modifying that information with the additional information that the cardinality of the group is the amount denoted by the number (three). Specific constructions (a.k.a. criteria, tests, evidence) are used to define word classes. (Section 1.2.3)">construction</a> where the <a href="#matrix-clause-(cxn)" title="matrix clause [cxn]

the clause in a complex sentence construction that also contains a dependent clause; the dependent clause is a dependent of the matrix clause. Example: in She watered the plants before she ate lunch, She watered the plants is an instance of a matrix clause; before she ate lunch is a dependent clause. A matrix clause is often, but not always, a main clause; it may be a subordinate clause that is itself dependent on another matrix clause.">matrix clause</a> expresses that the <a href="#gradable-predicative-scale-(sem)" title="gradable predicative scale [sem]

in a comparative construction or an equative construction, the predicate that defines the scale on which the comparee and standard are located. Example: in Your cat is as big as my dog, size is the gradable predicative scale on which it is asserted that the position of the cat is the same as the position of the dog. (Section 17.2.1)">gradable predicative scale</a> applies to the <a href="#comparee-(sem)" title="comparee [sem]

in a comparative construction or equative construction, the referent whose position on the gradable predicative scale is specified relative to the position of the standard on the predicative scale. Example: in the comparative construction Your cat is bigger than my dog, the cat is the comparee – it is asserted to exceed the dog on the scale of size. (Sections 17.2.1, 17.2.4)">comparee</a>, and a relative clause expresses that the same scale applies to the <a href="#standard-(sem)" title="standard [sem]

in a comparative construction or equative construction, the referent whose position on the gradable predicative scale serves as the reference point for the position of the comparee on the predicative scale. Example: in Your cat is bigger than my dog, the dog serves as the standard for the position of the cat on the scale of size – it is asserted that the cat exceeds the dog on that scale. (Section 17.2.1)">standard</a>. The relative clause is reduced to a <a href="#relativizer-(str)" title="relativizer [str]

a form that signals that an action is being used as a modifier – that is, it signals a relative clause. Example: in I ate the cheesecake [that Carol baked], that is the relativizer. A relativizer makes a relative clause construction syndetic. (Section 19.2.1)">relativizer</a> and an <a href="#argument-phrase-(cxn)" title="argument phrase [cxn]

a referring phrase that refers to an argument. Example: in The tree fell, the tree is an argument phrase because it is a referring phrase that refers to the argument of the predicate – namely, the tree that fell. Argument phrases are divided into core argument phrases (subject phrase, object phrase) and oblique argument phrases. (Sections 2.2.2, 6.6.1)">argument phrase</a> expressing the standard; the <a href="#zero-strategy-(str)" title="zero strategy [str]

the strategy of recruiting a construction without any overt coding of predication (i.e. no copula), and without any inflection, for different types of predication. Example: Tiwi purukupaɹli maɹtina Purukuparli is boss simply juxtaposes the referring phrases for Purukuparli and boss. (Section 10.2)">zero strategy</a> is used for <a href="#predicate-identity-(cxn)" title="predicate identity [cxn]

a complex sentence construction in which the events denoted by the predicate in the two clauses are of the same type. Example: Sumie saw the dog and Norie the cat is an instance of a predicate identity coordinate clause construction: the event denoted by the predicate in both clauses is seeing. (Section 16.5)">predicate identity</a>. <em>Example</em>: Lithuanian <em>Šiandien taip šalta kaip vakar</em> <q>Today it is as cold as yesterday</q> is an instance of the relative-based equative strategy: <em>Šiandien taip šalta</em> <q>today [is] so cold</q> is the matrix clause, with the degree marker <em>taip</em> <q>so</q>, and <em>kaip vakar</em> <q>how yesterday</q> is the relative-based clause, with the pronoun <em>kaip</em> <q>how</q>, the standard, <q>yesterday</q>, and a zero predicate. Typically the relative-based equative recruits a correlative relative clause, with a <a href="#free-relative-clause-(cxn)" title="free relative clause [cxn]

a relative clause construction in which the head has one of several possible indefinite functions – that is, specific, irrealis, free choice, and/or universal. Example: in Take what(ever) you like, what(ever) you like is a free relative clause using a headless strategy, and in Take anything you like, anything you like is a free relative clause using an overt head strategy. (Section 19.4)">free</a> (<a href="#indefinite-pronoun-article-(cxn)" title="indefinite pronoun/article [cxn]

this term is applied to referring phrases – pronouns and articles combined with nouns – that are associated with the bottom end of the information status continuum, where the identity of the referent is not known to speaker or hearer (or both). This includes pragmatically specific, pragmatically nonspecific (but semantically specific), and various categories of nonspecific referents (see Table 3.4 and Sections 3.4–3.5). Example: a glass bowl is an example of an indefinite referring phrase, used in a context where the individual glass bowl in question is not identifiable by the hearer. (Table 3.4, Section 3.3.1)">indefinite head</a>) <a href="#relative-clause-(cxn)" title="relative clause [cxn]

the dependent clause in a relative clause construction. The relative clause denotes the event that is used to modify the relative clause head referent.

(Section 19.1)">relative</a> or interrogative-based <a href="#relative-pronoun-(cxn)" title="relative pronoun [cxn]

a pronoun form that is unique to the relative clause construction, and is found in the externally headed relative clause construction using the relative pronoun strategy.

Specific constructions (a.k.a. criteria, tests, evidence) are used to define word classes. (Section 1.2.3)">cxn</a></dd>

Example: In There's a coyote running down the street!, It's a coyote that's running down the street, and The coyote is running down the street, the propositional content shared by the thetic, identificational, and topic–comment constructions, respectively, is the current running event with a coyote as the runner and the street as the location of the running.

the basic unit of morphosyntactic analysis; a construction is a conventional pairing of form and function – its form is morphosyntactic structure, and its function is a combination of meaning (semantic content) and information packaging (Section 1.1). When combined with a modifier describing a specific construction, [Modifier] construction refers to any pairing of form and function in a language (or any language) used to express a particular combination of semantic content and information packaging denoted by the modifier of construction (Section 1.4). Example: the numeral modification construction exemplified by three tree-s consists of a form which: (i) can be described schematically as [Num Noun-number]; (ii) performs the function of referring to a group of objects of the type denoted by the noun (tree), and modifying that information with the additional information that the cardinality of the group is the amount denoted by the number (three). Specific constructions (a.k.a. criteria, tests, evidence) are used to define word classes. (Section 1.2.3)">constructions</a> used to express this function. The speech acts that are most likely to be expressed as distinct constructions are the <a href="#declarative-(inf)" title="declarative [inf] ⟹ declarative [inf/cxn]

a speech act which simply asserts its propositional content, and the construction that expresses this speech act. Example: The English sentence Sandra picked up the children is an instance of a declarative speech act. The declarative is the most common speech act construction, and is considered the default speech act construction. (Section 12.1)">declarative</a>, the <a href="#interrogative-(inf)" title="interrogative [inf] ⟹ interrogative [inf/cxn]

a speech act which requests information, usually of the addressee, regarding uncertain or unknown information that is part of the propositional content of the question; and the construction that expresses this speech act. Interrogatives are divided into polarity questions, information questions, and alternative questions. (Sections 12.1, 12.3)">interrogative</a>, the <a href="#imperative-hortative-(inf)" title="imperative–hortative [inf] ⟹ imperative–hortative [inf/cxn]

a speech act which requests that the action expressed in the propositional content of the imperative–hortative be carried out, prototypically by the addressee but possibly by other persons; and the construction that expresses this speech act. Example: Dance! is an example of the English imperative–hortative construction for the second person, and Let's dance! is an example of the same for the first person plural. The term hortative is sometimes used for a first person imperative–hortative, and jussive for a third person imperative–hortative. A negative imperative–hortative is a prohibitive. (Sections 12.1, 12.4)">imperative–hortative</a> and its negative the <a href="#prohibitive-(inf)" title="prohibitive [inf] ⟹ prohibitive [inf/cxn]

a negative imperative–hortative speech act, and the construction that expresses that speech act. Example: English Don't be a fool! is an instance of a prohibitive; the construction uses a special prohibitive morpheme Don't to express prohibitive function. (Section 12.4.1)">prohibitive</a>, and the <a href="#exclamative-(inf)" title="exclamative [inf] ⟹ exclamative [inf/cxn]

a speech act which expresses a strong emotional reaction to the propositional content that it conveys; and the construction that expresses this speech act. More precisely, the exclamative speech act expresses the speaker's surprise toward the degree of a scalar property contained in the propositional content of the speech act; the rest of the propositional content consists of a presupposed open proposition. Example: What a beautiful house! is an instance of an English exclamative construction. (Sections 12.1, 12.5)">exclamative</a>. (Section 12.1)</dd>

Example: in Alarms ringing, the burglar fled, the clause the burglar fled is pragmatically asserted. The criterion typically used for pragmatic assertion is that the content of a sentence can be negated or questioned, though other criteria are sometimes used, such as hedging.

a referent of which something is being predicated. Example: in Masha is nice, being nice is being predicated of the referent Masha, and hence the referent Masha is an argument. Most referents are also arguments, but it is possible for a referent to stand alone in discourse, particularly in spoken discourse, independent of any predication. Arguments are divided into core arguments (subject and object) and peripheral arguments.

the basic unit of morphosyntactic analysis; a construction is a conventional pairing of form and function – its form is morphosyntactic structure, and its function is a combination of meaning (semantic content) and information packaging (Section 1.1). When combined with a modifier describing a specific construction, [Modifier] construction refers to any pairing of form and function in a language (or any language) used to express a particular combination of semantic content and information packaging denoted by the modifier of construction (Section 1.4). Example: the numeral modification construction exemplified by three tree-s consists of a form which: (i) can be described schematically as [Num Noun-number]; (ii) performs the function of referring to a group of objects of the type denoted by the noun (tree), and modifying that information with the additional information that the cardinality of the group is the amount denoted by the number (three). Specific constructions (a.k.a. criteria, tests, evidence) are used to define word classes. (Section 1.2.3)">construction</a> (the <q class="dq">less transitive</q> end of the hierarchy).

the basic unit of morphosyntactic analysis; a construction is a conventional pairing of form and function – its form is morphosyntactic structure, and its function is a combination of meaning (semantic content) and information packaging (Section 1.1). When combined with a modifier describing a specific construction, [Modifier] construction refers to any pairing of form and function in a language (or any language) used to express a particular combination of semantic content and information packaging denoted by the modifier of construction (Section 1.4). Example: the numeral modification construction exemplified by three tree-s consists of a form which: (i) can be described schematically as [Num Noun-number]; (ii) performs the function of referring to a group of objects of the type denoted by the noun (tree), and modifying that information with the additional information that the cardinality of the group is the amount denoted by the number (three).
