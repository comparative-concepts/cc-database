    the semantic relation between two <a>events</a> where one event serves as the opposite of the intended outcome of bringing about the other event.

    a <a>strategy</a> for expressing the categories of <a>subject</a> (S), <a>verb</a> (V), and <a inf:object-argument>object</a> (O) in a <a>transitive construction</a>, and <a>subject</a> in an <a>intransitive construction</a>. Some linguists use <a>A</a> and <a>P</a> instead of S and O, respectively, in describing the basic word order of transitive constructions. Basic word order is distinguished from nonbasic word orders in terms of <a>information packaging</a> (basic word order represents <a inf:topic-comment>topic--comment</a> information packaging); less <a>structural coding</a>; and higher <a>token frequency</a>. <i>Example</i>: the basic word order of English is SVO, as in <i>Jerry saw the bluebird on Sunday</i>. Some linguists analyze basic word order in terms of the pair of binary orders subject--verb and object--verb. Sometimes the order of oblique phrases is included; if so, the oblique phrase is abbreviated X; English is SVOX. (Section 6.2.2)

    a construction that performs the function of <a>predication</a>, including the <a>predicate</a> (which may be a <a>complex predicate</a>) and the <a>referring phrases</a> and other roles dependent on the predication. Example: <i>The birds were singing</i> is an instance of a clausal construction.

The prototypical predicational clause is a <a>verbal clause</a>. (Sections 1.3, 2.2.2, 6.1.1)
    <br />
    a <a>clause construction</a> that consists of the <a>predicate</a> and the <a>argument phrases</a> that are <a>dependent</a> on that predicate. <i>Example</i>: the clause <i>The engineers placed sandbags on the levee</i> is an instance of an English argument structure construction made up of the predicate (<i>placed</i>) and the combination of three argument phrases, the Subject (<i>the engineers</i>) plus the Object (<i>sandbags</i>) plus the Oblique (<i>on the levee</i>). The <a>function</a> of the argument structure construction is its <a>semantics</a> -- the <a>participant roles</a> that the <a>referents</a> of the argument phrases are playing in the event -- combined with its <a>information packaging</a> -- the relative <a>salience</a> implied by the Subject -- Object -- Oblique ranking of argument phrases.

    a <a>strategy</a> in which an <a sem:object-concept>object</a> in an <a>ownership</a>, <a>body part</a>, <a>kinship</a>, etc., relation -- that is, a relation typically expressed in a <a>possessive modification construction</a> -- to a <a>participant</a> in an <a>event</a> (normally in the <a>P role</a> or sometimes the <a>S role</a> of the event) is expressed with a possessive modification construction, even if the object in that relation is also itself a participant in the event. <i>Example</i>: in Mokilese <i>ngoah insigeh-di kijinlikkoan-oaw nih-mw</i> <q>I wrote a letter to / for you</q>, <i>nih-mw</i> [<sc>clf-2sg.poss</sc>] <q>your</q> is a possessive modifier of <i>kijinlikkoan-oaw</i> <q>a letter</q>, even though the addressee is also a central participant in the <a>transfer event</a>. This Mokilese example is also an instance of the <a>internal recipient strategy</a>, but the internal possessor strategy also includes the expression of objects in an ownership, etc., relation that are not (necessarily) also participants in the event. The <a>adnominal possessive strategy</a> is also an instance of the internal possessor strategy. (Section 7.5.3)

  Definition: >-
    the diachronic process by which a complex <a>morphosyntactic</a> structure develops an idiosyncratic <a>meaning</a>, and so comes to form one unit, in the sense of a pairing of a <a>form</a> and a unitary, unanalyzable meaning. <i>Example</i>: the English phrase <i>jack-in-the-pulpit</i> has lexicalized to denote a particular species of plant.

For example <i>red-winged blackbird</i> describes a specific species of bird, but the phrase is partially analyzable in that the bird is mostly black but has a patch of red on its wings.

    the <a>strategy</a> of construing the <u>affected</u> <a>subject</a> <a>participant</a> as a single <a>role</a> in a <a>reflexive</a> or <a>reciprocal event</a>; hence, it is expressed by a single <a>argument phrase</a> in a <a>reflexive construction</a> or a <a>reciprocal construction</a>. <i>Examples</i>: English <i>Sam shaved</i> and <i>Mary and Sue met</i> construe the participants -- Sam, and Mary and Sue, respectively -- as playing a single role in the shaving and meeting events. The single role strategy may also be overtly coded: the Abkhaz Reflexive <i>l-c̜ə-l-k°abe-yt'</i> <q>She washed (herself)</q> is an Intransitive Verb form with the Reflexive prefix <i>c̜ə-</i>, and the Swahili Reciprocal <i>wa-na-pend-an-a</i> <q>they love each other</q> is an Intransitive Verb form with the Reciprocal suffix <i>-an</i>.

  Examples:
    - <e>Sam shaved</e>
    - <e>Mary and Sue met</e>
    - Language: Abkhaz

Comrie (2003b) restricts verb-coding strategies to languages which use voice forms that are exclusively found in relative clause constructions (and thus would exclude the Luganda example); we follow the broader definition introduced in Keenan (1972).

  Definition: >-
    the set of words defined by their occurrence in a particular <a>role</a> in a <a>construction</a>. <i>Example</i>: in the English Predicate Adjective Construction [<sc>Sbj</sc> <i>be</i> <sc>PredAdj</sc>], illustrated by <i>She is intelligent</i>, the PredAdj role defines a word class consisting of all the words that can occur in that role in that construction (<i>happy</i>, <i>tall</i>, <i>asleep</i>, etc.). Word classes are defined by a set of constructions that the words occur in (<i>a.k.a.</i> distribution, behavior, properties). (Section 1.2.1)

- Id: str:word-order
  Type: str
  Name: word order
  SubtypeOf:
    - str:encoding-strategy
  Definition: >-
    the relative order of two <a>elements</a> in a <a>construction</a>. <i>Example</i>: in English <i>red book</i>, the <a>adjective</a> <i>red</i> precedes the <a>noun</a> <i>book</i>; but in Spanish <i>libro rojo</i>, the adjective <i>rojo</i> <q>red</q> follows the noun <i>libro</i> <q>book</q>. (Sections <b>4.2</b>, 5.3, 6.2.2)
  Examples:
    - red book
    - Language: Spanish
      Example: libro rojo
      EquivalentPieces:
        - rojo | red
        - libro | book

  Type: str
  Name: yes/no alignment

  SubtypeOf:
    - str:polarity-response-alignment
  Definition: >-
    an <a>alignment strategy</a> for the <a>polarity response construction</a> in which the answer to a negative <a cxn:polarity-question-construction>polarity question</a> aligns the polarity of the answer, not the polarity of the speaker's question. <i>Example</i>: in English, the answer to the negative polarity question <i>Do you not have any money?</i> where the addressee does not have any money is <i>No</i>; the polarity of the response matches the polarity of the answer (that the addressee does not have any money). (Section 12.3.3)
  Examples:
    - Do you not have any money? - No

- Id: str:yes-no-disagree-alignment
  Type: str
  Name: yes/no/disagree alignment
  Alias:
    - yes/no/disagree alignment (strategy)
  SubtypeOf:
    - str:polarity-response-alignment
  Definition: >-
    an <a>alignment strategy</a> for the <a>polarity response construction</a> in which the answer to a negative <a cxn:polarity-question-construction>polarity question</a> aligns the polarity of the answer when the answer is negative, but uses a special disagreeing form when the answer is positive. <i>Example</i>: in French, when the question is <q>Do you not have any money?</q>, the answer <i>non</i> <q>no</q> indicates that the respondent has no money, but the answer <i>si</i> (different from the positive answer <i>oui</i> <q>yes</q>) indicates that the respondent disagrees with the speaker and indeed does have money. (Section 12.3.3)
  Examples:
    - Do you not have any money?
    - non
    - si
    - oui

  Name: zero coding, zero coded
  Alias:
    - zero coding (strategy)

  SubtypeOf:

  Definition: >-
    a <a>strategy</a> in which there is no overt <a>form</a> in the <a>construction</a> that encodes the relevant <a>function</a> of the construction. <i>Example</i>: in the English Adjectival Modification Construction illustrated by <i>tall trees</i>, there is no overt form that codes the <a>modification</a> function of the <a>property concept</a> denoted by <i>tall</i>. (Section 2.4)
  Examples:

(Section 10.2)
  Examples:
    - Language: Tiwi
