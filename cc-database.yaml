A partially merged argument structure strategy is typically, but not always, associated with a <a>deranked</a> complement clause construction.

The relative clause is reduced to a <a>relativizer</a> and an <a>argument phrase</a> expressing the standard; the <a>zero strategy</a> is used for <a>predicate identity</a>. <i>Example</i>: Lithuanian <i>Šiandien taip šalta kaip vakar</i> <q>Today it is as cold as yesterday</q> is an instance of the relative-based equative strategy: <i>Šiandien taip šalta</i> <q>today [is] so cold</q> is the matrix clause, with the degree marker <i>taip</i> <q>so</q>, and <i>kaip vakar</i> <q>how yesterday</q> is the relative-based clause, with the pronoun <i>kaip</i> <q>how</q>, the standard, <q>yesterday</q>, and a zero predicate.

    - support verb [cxn]
  Definition: >-
    a <a>strategy</a> used for <a>nonprototypical predication</a>, which uses a morpheme different from the <a>object</a> concept word, the <a>copula</a>, which is inflected for at least some of the categories that prototypical <a>predication</a> <a>constructions</a> in the language -- that is, predication constructions headed by a <a>verb</a> -- also inflect for. Example: in the English Predicate Nominal Construction, illustrated by <i>Sam is a bloodhound</i>, <i>is</i> is a copula that inflects for <a>person</a>, <a>number</a>, and <a>tense</a> like English Verbs do.

  Definition: >-
    the <a>strategy</a> of <a>recruiting</a> what was originally the <a>action</a> <a>predication</a> <a>construction</a> for <a>nonprototypical predication</a>. It is presumed that an originally action predication construction lacks an <a>auxiliary</a>, and it expresses certain grammatical categories, in particular <a>person indexation</a> and <a>negation</a>. <i>Example</i>: Nahuatl <i>ni-ti:citl</i> [<sc>1sg</sc>-doctor] <q>I am a doctor</q> recruits the action predication construction for <a>object</a> <a>predication</a>; cf. <i>ni-cho:ca</i> [<sc>1sg</sc>-cry] <q>I am crying</q>.

    a model of how experiences are expressed in language developed by Chafe (1977 and later publications) and elaborated in Croft (2007a). In this book, one part of this model, <a>particularizing</a>, is described with respect to the structure of <a>referring phrases</a>. (Section 4.1.1)

  ConstituentOf: []
  AssociatedTo: []
  Definition: >-
    an <a>argument structure construction</a> that expresses the relationship between the <a>participant roles</a> of an <a>event</a> expressed in a clause and their relative <a>salience</a> (topicality). <i>Examples</i>: <i>The grizzlies ate the salmon</i> and <i>The salmon were eaten by the grizzlies</i> are instances of contrasting voice constructions, the <a>basic voice construction</a> and the <a>nonbasic voice construction</a> (specifically, the <a>passive--inverse construction</a>), which are appropriate in different discourse contexts, depending on whether the grizzlies or the salmon is the more salient participant at that point in the discourse.

    - event-central [cxn]
  Definition: >-
    a situation type describing the weather that is typically construed as <a>thetic</a>. <i>Examples</i>: <i>It's raining</i> and <i>The wind is blowing</i> are expressions of weather. Weather is sometimes described as an <a>event</a> without any (<a>salient</a>) <a>participants</a>. Its tendency to be construed as thetic is attributed to the fact that weather is difficult to divide into a <a>topic</a> and a <a>comment</a> and be construed as <a>topic--comment information packaging</a>.

  Definition: >-
    an <a>evaluative event</a> in which a positive evaluative judgment about a <a>proposition</a> expressed by the <a>complement</a> of the wishing event is made, and there is a <a>negative epistemic stance</a> by the speaker toward the proposition. <i>Example</i>: in <i>Jill wishes that Joe had won the election</i>, the wishing predicate <i>wishes</i> expresses Jill's evaluation of Joe's winning the election, and also presupposes that the speaker believes that Joe didn't win the election.

Word classes are defined by a set of constructions that the words occur in (<i>a.k.a.</i> distribution, behavior, properties). (Section 1.2.1)

  Definition: >-
    an <a>alignment strategy</a> for the <a>polarity response construction</a> in which the answer to a negative <a>polarity question</a> aligns the polarity of the answer, not the polarity of the speaker's question. <i>Example</i>: in English, the answer to the negative polarity question <i>Do you not have any money?</i> where the addressee does not have any money is <i>No</i>; the polarity of the response matches the polarity of the answer (that the addressee does not have any money).

    an <a>alignment strategy</a> for the <a>polarity response construction</a> in which the answer to a negative <a>polarity question</a> aligns the polarity of the answer when the answer is negative, but uses a special disagreeing form when the answer is positive. <i>Example</i>: in French, when the question is <q>Do you not have any money?</q>, the answer <i>non</i> <q>no</q> indicates that the respondent has no money, but the answer <i>si</i> (different from the positive answer <i>oui</i> <q>yes</q>) indicates that the respondent disagrees with the speaker and indeed does have money.
